# 📈 Female Education and Economic Growth
### Capstone Data Science Project for Social Good

---

## 🌍 Project Overview
Female education is widely recognized as a critical driver of long-term economic development.  
This capstone project explores the relationship between **female education levels and economic growth** across countries using global datasets.

The project applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to uncover insights that can support **data-driven policy decisions**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between female education and GDP per capita  
- Perform exploratory data analysis on global education and economic indicators  
- Build regression models to quantify the relationship  
- Interpret results and provide policy-oriented recommendations  

---

## 📂 Data Source
- **World Bank Open Data**
  - Female education indicators
  - GDP per capita (economic indicator)

Datasets are stored in the `data/` directory.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  

### Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  

- **Development Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Reshaping
- Removed irrelevant columns (Indicator Code, Indicator Name, unnamed columns)
- Converted datasets from wide to long format using `melt`
- Merged education and GDP datasets using **Country** and **Year**
- Handled missing values and corrected data types

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed global trends in female education
- Compared education levels with GDP per capita
- Observed a **moderate positive correlation (~0.43)** between female education and economic growth

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering & Data Preparation
- Defined feature set (X) and target variable (Y)
- Performed train-test split
- Applied feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

### 4️⃣ Model Building & Evaluation
- Trained multiple regression models
- Compared linear and non-linear approaches
- Interpreted model outputs and trends

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Countries with higher female education levels tend to have higher GDP per capita  
- Female education shows a consistent positive association with economic growth  
- Education alone does not fully explain economic growth, indicating the influence of additional socio-economic factors  

Model outputs and visualizations are available in the `output/` folder.

---

## 💡 Policy Recommendations
- Governments should prioritize investment in female education  
- Education initiatives should be supported by broader economic and social development programs  
- Data-driven policy planning can lead to sustainable long-term growth  

---

## 🚀 Conclusion
This capstone project demonstrates how data science can be applied to socially impactful problems.  
The findings reinforce the importance of female education while highlighting the complexity of economic growth drivers.
